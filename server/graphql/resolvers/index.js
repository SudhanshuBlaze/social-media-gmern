// Note: While we use 'queries' to fetch data, we use 'mutations' to modify server-side data. If 'queries' are the GraphQL equivalent to GET calls in REST, then 'mutations' represent the state-changing methods in REST (like DELETE , PUT , PATCH , etc)

// Mutations are used  to insert, update, or delete data.
